# InsultKeyGen
A string converter that converts text into lines that look like software keys. Happy Trolling.

# About 
Inspired by this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/Deck13_de/status/811883652904865792) made by the German game developer Deck13, I decided it would be fun to write a small interface for parsing regular strings into key-lookalikes.

# How to compile

This project uses WPF in a Visual Studio 2015 solution.
